# Dot

Got struck with "framework fatigue" in regards what it comes to dotfile repos, mainly because:

 1. My terminal got really really slow over the time. Opening a new tab would take 5-10 seconds open.
 2. There's a lot of unnecessary cruft bundled that I don't have any use for.

So instead of fixing the problem, I decided to wipe out and start off of a clean slate and in the process learn how [`zsh`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) actually works.

I will probably end up repeating a lot of mistakes solved by a lot of dotfile repos, but this will be good practice in organizing my shell environment and how things are put together.

So if you end up using these, that's awesome! If you find some stupidity, [open an issue](https://github.com/stuf/dot/issues) or [ping me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/piparkaq).
