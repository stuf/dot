# Dot

Got struck with "framework fatigue" in regards what it comes to dotfile repos, mainly because:

 1. My terminal got really really slow over the time. Opening a new tab would take 5-10 seconds open.
 2. There's a lot of unnecessary cruft bundled that I don't have any use for.

So instead of fixing the problem, I decided to wipe out and start off of a clean slate and in the process learn how [`zsh`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) actually works.

I will probably end up repeating a lot of mistakes solved by a lot of dotfile repos, but this will be good practice in organizing my shell environment and how things are put together.

## Installation

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stuf/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```
